# linear_system_solver_II
Solves the linear system Ax=b as sum of null space of A and particular solution of the system.

This python program takes input as coefficient matrix A and vector b and then returns the solution of the linear system as sum of null space of A and particular solution of the linear system.

Instructions:

Run linear_system.py and then enter the inputs as required.  The program would print the solution of the system as the sum of null space of A and particular solution of the linear system.
